My-Pychess was started by me as a small hobby project, I
had hoped I would finish it within a month. But, I could
never stop on improving it. I kept on adding more and more
features which I still do today. I follow 4 principles:
    
      "Fix a lot of functionality in a small piece of code."
I like to have a lot of features and keep the code very small.

          "Do not compromise on readability of code."
This is important, not only for others to read your code, but
even for you.

    "Try to do as much testing as you can to avoid bugs."
Bugs are literally the worst. I am always trying to minimise
them. 


                          Lastly and most importantly,
                                "Enjoy what you do."
                          That's what keeps me going.
