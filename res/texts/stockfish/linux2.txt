Your OS was not on the list. No problem, just head over
to downloads page of stockfishchess.org and download the
zip file for linux. After unzipping, navigate inside the
Linux folder and try to run any executable.

If it gives a line of text like:
'Stockfish 11 by T. Romstad, ...... etc', then the
EXECUTABLE IS WORKING. If that does not work (in most
cases it won't), you have to build the executable from
source.

To achieve this, there are lot of online tutorials.
Follow any one to get a WORKING EXECUTABLE, test it
by the method given above.

FINALLY, AFTER you got a working executable, place it
as the following file (after renaming the exectable to
'stockfish')
