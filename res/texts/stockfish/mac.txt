This is the Mac installation guide for stockfish. If you have
homebrew installed on your system, enter in shell:
>>> brew install stockfish

If you do not have homebrew, you have to install it first by
typing this in shell:
>>> /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubuser
content.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

After this step, you can use the 'brew install stockfish'
command on your shell.

NOTE 1: For now, Mac users have only one option, using
homebrew. Using an executable directly is not supported
yet.

NOTE 2: I DO NOT HAVE A MAC, SO THIS METHOD OF 
INSTALLATION IS NOT TESTED BY ME. BUT IT SHOULD 
STILL WORK NONETHELESS.
