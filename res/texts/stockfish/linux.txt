If you are running Debian or Debian-based OS (like Ubuntu,
Mint, Raspbian, etc), open the shell and type:
>>> sudo apt-get install stockfish

If you are running Fedora, do:
>>> sudo dnf install stockfish

If you are running openSUSE or similar OS, do:
>>> sudo zypper install stockfish

If you are running centOS or similar OS, do:
>>> sudo yum install stockfish

If your OS has any package manager, use it to install
stockfish and your job is done.


Your OS is not on this list and has no package managers?
